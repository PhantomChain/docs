# Events


In order to create efficient integrations on your server, similar to how webhooks work, an event emitter will inform you about any events that could require actions to be performed like missing a block.

## Emitting Events

Emitting events is pretty straightforward. Just resolve the `event-emitter` from `@phantomcore/core-container` and call the `emit` method with a name and data to be emitted.

```js
const container = require('@phantomcore/core-container')
const emitter = container.resolvePlugin('event-emitter')

emitter.emit('block.forged', {
  id: 'fake-id',
  generatorPublicKey: 'fake-generator-public-key',
  amount: 10
})
```

## Listening to Events

Listening to events is as straightforward as emitting them. Just resolve the `event-emitter` from `@phantomcore/core-container` and call the `on` method with a name and then process the incoming data.

```js
const container = require('@phantomcore/core-container')
const emitter = container.resolvePlugin('event-emitter')

emitter.on('block.forged', block => {
  if (block.generatorPublicKey === 'fake-generator-public-key') {
    console.log(`You just forged a block for ${block.amount} PHANTOM`)
  }
})
```

## Available Events

**delegate.registered**
This event will be emitted when a wallet registers as a delegate.

**delegate.resigned**

**forger.missing**
This event will be emitted when the forger is missing a block.

**forger.started**
This event will be emitted when the forger is started.

**peer.added**
