# Vote Report

## Installation

```bash
yarn add @arkecosystem/core-vote-report
```

## **Alias**

`vote-report`

## **Implementation**

[vote-report](https://github.com/ArkEcosystem/core/tree/develop/packages/core-vote-report)

## **Summary**

The `vote-report` package creates a webpage showing various delegate statistics for the network the current node is running on. This package is primarily useful as a lightweight alternative to a full explorer node, as it runs on-node with no external installations required.

This package can also be used to sanity-check your node. Note that this should not be your first troubleshooting step â€” your node console likely has more focused error handling messages. However, by checking the values in your `vote-report` and comparing them to your network's explorer, you can make sure that your node is fully synced with the network.

## Usage

To use the `vote-report` package, add it to your plugins file in your config directory. After doing so and restarting your node, connect to your vote report page by visiting `YOUR.NODE.IP.ADDR:4006`. If your node IP is `123.456.789.0`, for example, `123.456.789.0:4006` will take you to your vote report page.

## **Default Settings**
```js
{
  host: process.env.ARK_VOTE_REPORT_HOST || '0.0.0.0',
  port: process.env.ARK_VOTE_REPORT_PORT || 4006,
}
```
