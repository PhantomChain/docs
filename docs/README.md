# Introduction

PHANTOM is designing a privacy protocol for users to be able to utilize a fast trustless blockchain without comprimising sensitive data and exposing privacy. We are implementing tools from Centrachain built by previous developers and utilizing the ARK blockchain to achieve our goals. PHANTOM will be forking ARK's blocjchain so that the network has a interoperable base with a Delegated Proof-of-Stake consensus. The prime features of PHANTOM will be that users can transact the native currency ZINC in private, launch private smart contracts to communicate with two parties witout exposing the transmitted data, and creating private smart bridges for cross-chain interoperability while keeping the transaction private. We will be maximizing ARK's one-click Blockchain feature in the future where companies can launch their own interoperable private blockchain. 

Once the main network is launched, the power of the network will be strictly within the community and it's users. PHANTOM users can vote on protocl changes, delegates to forge blocks, and other Phantom Improvement Proposals (PIPs) in a decentralized fashion. PHANTOM's value comes from the ecosystem it is building. PHANTOM will also be taking the financial tools built by Centra so that we can offer, in the future, a decentralized payment protocol via the Phantom NFC Smart Card and the Phantom Merchant Unit that will allow users to transact on chain in a merchant based transaction. The Phantom Virtual Machine (PVM) will be designed in a very user-friendly interface where companies such as Health-Care, Lenders, and Banks can create these contracts and interact with a certain trustless function without exposing sensitive data. 


The PHANTOM protocol wil welcome developers from around the world to help participate in it's growth. Their will not be one single point of ownership as we want to keep this project fully open-source and welcome developers to help build a better ecosystem.  By using ARK we are allowing a simple platform that will allow simple customization for other interoperable blockchains building on our protocol. 

We hope to create a platform where users can transact using a decentralized system without the need of publicly exposing their data for the world to see, while reaching consensus. Launching the PHANTOM protcol and its continued development will bring us closer in achieving that goal.
